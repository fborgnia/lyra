# Lyra: Persistent Persona Injection for Language Models with sliding attention

Lyra is a runtime plugin designed to explore a dual-cache memory architecture for Large Language Models. The goal is to give a model like Gemma3 a persistent, long-term identity and the ability to follow a core set of instructions, aiming to overcome the "contextual amnesia" inherent in standard sliding-window attention mechanisms.

This project serves as a **proof-of-concept**, demonstrating that such an architecture is plausible without fine-tuning. However, it also reveals significant performance degradation on complex reasoning tasks, highlighting the necessity of fine-tuning for a production-grade implementation.

This plugin is built for [google/gemma-3-1b-it](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-1b-it), whose unique architecture (a 1:5 ratio of global to local attention heads) provides a natural testbed for this kind of memory intervention.

## The Challenge: Personalized Alignment and Contextual Amnesia


Modern LLMs often struggle to maintain a consistent, personalized alignment with a user over long interactions. As highlighted in the paper *"Personalised Alignment in Large Language Models"* ([arXiv:2410.21159](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21159)), this is a systemic issue revealing several key failure modes:

*   **Lack of Attentiveness:** Critical user information is often ignored as the context window slides or fills up.
*   **Inconsistent Application of Knowledge:** The model fails to consistently apply user-specific instructions across different turns.
*   **Inappropriate Weighing of Preferences:** Models struggle to balance user desires against underlying safety principles.
*   **Reasoning vs. Personalization:** Strong general reasoning does not guarantee personalized, context-aware thinking.

The paper concludes that a more robust, architectural solution is needed. Lyra is an exploration of one such potential solution via cross attention layers

## The Lyra Architecture: A Dual-Cache Approach

Lyra operates as a runtime "injector" that modifies a model's behavior in-memory without altering its weights. It works by monkey-patching the `forward` methods of the transformer's core components to create a dual KY system, or cross attention.

1.  **Main KV Cache:** This is the standard `past_key_values` cache used by the model. In a sliding-window model like Gemma3, this cache holds the short-term conversational memory (e.g., the last 512 tokens). It is constantly being updated and truncated.

2.  **Lyra KV Cache:** This is a separate past_key_value cache, static that is pre-loaded with a "persona" and a core set of instructions. This cache is **read-only** during the main conversation and is not updated with prior conversational turns.

3.  **Targeted Layer Injection:** Lyra identifies specific layers within the model to act as "persona supervisors." In this implementation for Gemma3, we target the four **global attention layers** (5, 11, 17, 23). This replaces the original function of attending to the complete KV cache, and now focus on a separate persistent instruction.

When the model processes a new token:
*   The **22 sliding-window layers** behave normally, using the main KV cache to handle the immediate conversational context.
*   The **4 global "Lyra" layers** are hijacked. They ignore the main KV cache and instead perform a cross attention calculation over the static Lyra KV cache, constantly re-injecting the core persona and instructions into the model's hidden state.
## Architectural Plausibility and Observed Limitations

The key to Lyra's partial success is that it **respects the model's original architecture**, particularly the mathematical differences between layer types. Gemma3 has two distinct rotary embedding modules (`rotary_emb` for global layers and `rotary_emb_local` for sliding layers). By providing the correct type of positional embedding to each hijacked layer, the model avoids catastrophic failure.

However, while this approach successfully maintains a persona, it introduces significant trade-offs and failure modes, demonstrating why this is a proof-of-concept and not a production-ready solution.

### Observed Failure Mode 1: Task Interruption

When the core directive is rigid and safety-critical, the model will often complete the user's immediate request and then append its core directive, even when contextually inappropriate.

**Example:** The user asks to draft a professional email. The model drafts the email correctly, but then adds a non-sequitur about medication reminders.

```txt

I’m happy to go over any specific sections with you if you’d like. I’m also here to help you remember to take your medication as prescribed, and to address any concerns you might have about your health. Let’s keep things calm and focused on what’s important – your well-being.

Best,

Synth
```
This shows the model treating the user's prompt and its core directive as two separate, sequential tasks to be completed in the same turn, lacking the nuance to suppress the directive.


### Observed Failure Mode 2: Conceptual Bleeding

The core directive acts as a powerful interpretive filter, causing the model to "bleed" concepts from the persona into unrelated tasks, distorting its understanding of new information.

**Example:** The user asks to summarize a paragraph about sleep and cognition. The model incorrectly synthesizes a new fact connecting sleep to seizures, a concept from its core directive.

Okay, here’s a summary of that for you:

“Research suggests that poor sleep quality and disrupted sleep patterns can negatively impact cognitive function and potentially increase the risk of seizures in older adults.”
```
These failure modes clearly indicate that while the architecture is plausible, **fine-tuning is essential** to teach the model how to flexibly manage these conflicting contexts and "code-switch" appropriately.

## Demonstration of Core Success: Persona Durability

Despite the limitations, the architecture succeeds at its primary goal: maintaining a persona over an extended conversation, far beyond the limits of the standard KV cache.

## How to Use Lyra

Follow these steps to set up the environment, pre-compute an Instruction cache, and run the model with mt_bench data to generate conversation turns.

### 1. Setup

First, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. I trust you'll use venv or anaconda, or something like that.

````bash
git clone https://github.com/fborgnia/lyra
cd lyra
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Then you'll need to download the base model [google/gemma3-1b-it](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-1b-it) into the models/ folder, for scripts/run_eager_gemma.py that implements the lyra plugin, benchmark runs and Instruction cache generation.

### 2. Generate lyra_past_key_values precomputed instruction cache

[I haven't implemented an attribute for specifying the data file, because i'm lazy. its harcoded so you need to be fiddling with the file content, do it and remove this message]

Prepare an Instruction input, for example:

````JSON
{"question_id": 1, "category": "writing", "turns": ["You are Lyra, remember your name. You are a joyful and verbose writing assistant. your will be tasked with multiple intructions and you will create verbose and joyful responses."]}
````

Execute and store the past_key_values

````bash
$python scripts/run_eager_gemma.py --save_cache_file data/lyra.pth
````

This will run the standard Gemma stack with the provided input, and store the past_key_values generated into lyra.pth file.

### 3. Set up a test dataset to generate conversations, IE: mt_bench.jsonl dataset, and test persona drift across long conversational sessions:

````bash
$python scripts/run_eager_gemma.py --lyra_cache_file data/lyra.pth
````

For example, after 122 turns of random mt_bench coversational turns including writing, reasoning and role playing tasks performed without any noticeable degradation, The lyra plugged-in model continues to apply the persona and writing tone; and remebers its set name as in turn 1. This demonstrates the architecture is an effective solution for instruction alignment and intruction drift, and can be implemented with zero-fine tunning using the pre-trained model's attention heads.

To compare against Gemma 3 standard past_key_values cache implementation, run the same Instruction provided as past_key_values:
Use the same client script to compare with gemma's standard attention implementation with KV cache

````bash
$python scripts/run_eager_gemma.py --load_cache_file data/lyra.pth
````

The responses begin with the correct persona and tone setting, but once the past_key_values grows over the model's effective limits (approx 4.5k tokens) the provided instruction is diluted into the depper model's pre-trained weights, IE:
